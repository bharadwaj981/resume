      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms.</p>
      <li><strong>Description:</strong></li>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;To deal with the problem there is essential need of prediction system for awareness about
      diseases. Machine learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that provides prestigious support
      in predicting any kind of event which take training from previous data. We calculate accuracy of
      machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. For this, algorithms like k-nearest neighbor,
      decision tree and linear regression are used for training and testing using UCI repository dataset.
